      <h2>Competitive High School Robotics</h2>
      <p>The Reynolds Reybots are a school-based team that designs and builds competition robots. The team meets year-round and operates like a small business, with different sub-teams that handle everything from marketing and fundraising to programming, mechanics, and electrical work. We operate on an apprenticeship model, where more experienced students lead and mentor more junior students to gain the skills and knowledge required. The collaborative effort of running a team and building and competing with robots provides a real world learning environment that is fun, exciting, and rewarding. As FIRST® founder Dean Kamen said, “We don’t use kids to build robots. We use robots to build kids.”</p>
